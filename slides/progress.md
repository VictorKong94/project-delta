# Background

## The Paper

- from OpenFMRI.org (ds005)
- "The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision-Making Under Risk" by Sabrina M. Tom et al.)

## The Data

- Examination of the neural systems that process decision utility with fMRI data
- 16 subjects, 1 task per subject, 3 runs per task


# Data Fetching and Preprocessing 

- Downloading data from OpenFRMI.org and decompressing it
- Plotting data to explore potential useful information for our project
- Drawing summary statistics from the plotted data

# Initial Analysis

## Convolution

## Smoothing 

## Linear Regression

- Multiple and single regression with stimulus

## Hypothesis Testing

- General t-tests

## Time Series

## PCA

# Our Plan

## Goal

- Trying to reproduce methods as well as adding our own thoughts into it

## Analysis to Perform

- Logistics regression

- Time series 

- Hypothesis tests

- Correlation analysis

- Robust regression analysis

- PCA

## Simplification Steps

## Issues We have Discussed

## Methods of validating models

- t-tests
- RSS

# Our Process

## Hardest Parts of the Project (cont'd)

## Success in Overcoming the Obstacles (cont'd)

## Issues With Working as a Team

- Not easy to meet together

## Most Useful Parts of Class

- Linear Modelling
- Correlation per voxel

## Least Helpful Parts of Class

- Comparison to R
- Mathematical Writing

# Our Process (cont'd)

## What We Need to Accomplish in the Project

## Difficulty in Making Work Reproducible

# Potential Topics to Cover in Future

- More linear regression (ANOVA), PCA
- Machine learning (classification, prediction, cross-validation)
- Permutation tests (bootstrap)
- Software tools (Git, Python)
