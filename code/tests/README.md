This directory contains files that are used to test the integrity of the code
stored within the `code/utils` directory. These tests can be run individually by
calling `nosetests code/tests/test_###`, where ### should be replaced by the
name of the file in `code/utils` whose code you intend to access. Beware that
you must have a valid set of the test dataset before most of these will work.
