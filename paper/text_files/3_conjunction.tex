% Conjunction Analysis

\par In the conjunction analysis, two figures depicting behavioral loss aversion
(both with and without the distance from indifference as a regressor) are
produced. Each figure shows three scatterplots (one for each run) complete with
ordinary least squares regression models. Each plot has on its horizontal axis
neural loss aversion and on its vertical axis the natural logarithm of
behavioral loss aversion. Outliers identified by robust regression are also
indicated by red dots on their respective plots, whereas ``inliers''
(non-outliers) are indicated by green dots.

\par \indent In each case, an ordinary least squares regression model is first
fit to the paired data points. The resultant model is then subjected to RANSAC,
an iterative algorithm which takes a subset of inliers and produces a robust
estimation of the model's parameters.
