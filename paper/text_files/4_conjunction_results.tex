\par \indent After obtaining neural and behavioral loss aversion, by
conjunction analysis, two figures below are generated to show the relationships
between neural and behavioral loss aversion. One is for the condition when
distance from indifference is included [Figure \ref{fig:cor1}], while the other exclude the distance from indifference [Figure \ref{fig:cor2}]. Each plot contains three subplots
for each run. Since two types of regression methods, original least square and
robust regression,are performed, we obtain two regression line. The black line is for OLS, while the blue line is for robust regression. In the plots, the outliers are labeled as red dots.
