\par \indent We select the feature gain, loss, response (0 or 1) behavioral
data and calculate the euclidean distance from each gain/loss combination to
the diagonal of the gamble matrix to perform the logistic regression. We
construct logistic model according to the definition of logistic regression. We
calculate the log likelihood and find the coefficients that result in the
maximum log likelihood. In order to make the model more accurate, we add a
penalty term to our model. Therefore, we have to estimate the tunning parameter
for this penalty term using cross validation.
