\par \indent Since we have four condition files for one subjects, we get four
neural stimulus from these four files and convolve with hemodynamic response
respectively. We construct a design matrix where the first column is all 1's
and the rest four columns are BOLD signals we obtain from convolution. The
response for linear regression is the BOLD images. Then by performing linear
regression, we will be able to get regression coefficients for intercepts
and four BOLD signals which corresponds to four conditions. We also calculate
the residual errors. In addition, we also identify outliers, perform linear
regression for two situations: with or without outliers, and compare the
difference.
