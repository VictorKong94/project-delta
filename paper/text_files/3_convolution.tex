\par \indent Since our study is constructed in event-related design, the onsets
are not evenly spaced. This causes problems when we use the traditional way to
convolve the canonical hemodynamic response function with the neural
prediction that we get from condition files. Therefore, we manually calculate
the convolution. Another problem we encountered is that the duration of each
second is too short. Usually, the hemodynamic response lasts 30 seconds when
an individual is facing a task. However, in our case, the duration for each
task is only three seconds. That is, all hemodynamic responses are overlapped,
and we need to be cautious when we convolve. So, at the same time point, we add
all the hemodynamic response and convolve with hemodynamics response regarding
to different onset, duration and amplitude. Since the one run lasts 480
seconds and time to repetition is 2, we remove the all the convolved BOLD
signals after 240 TR.
