\par By convolution, we get four simulated BOLD signals for four
conditions, as shown in [Figure \ref{fig:convolution}]. Before we perform linear regression, we try to find outliers first. So we plot the SD for each volume, as shown [Figure \ref{fig:VolumeSD}]. However, we did not find outliers. Then we perform linear regression and get MRSS about 40.38 which is relatively low. So this model fit the data pretty well.
