% TeX file: 5 Discussion of Results
\par \indent Though we haven't finished yet, the project has been in progress
as we planned. For one thing, prior to statistical analysis, we have smoothed 
the raw data and manually convolved the canonical hemodynamic response 
function. For another, we have applied several methods to do both neural 
decision analysis and behavioral decision analysis.

\par \indent Firstly, as for neural decision analysis, we performed linear
regression here and found no outliers, which implied this model fits the data
very well. Secondly, when doing the behavioral decision analysis, we have
constructed logistic models as well as performed hypothesis tests, which 
have not been finished yet. Nevertheless, we aim at finding out which feature 
has the biggest influence on an individual's behavior in this part. Last but 
not least, we also applied a multi-dimensional Gaussian filter to smooth the
bold image, based on our thought that convolution does not truncate the kernel.
