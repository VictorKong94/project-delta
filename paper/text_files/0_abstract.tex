\par It is a well-known fact that certain areas of the brain play a larger role
in some tasks than others. What is not as well-known at the moment is which
parts of the brain correspond to what roles, as well as how much they contribute
to these roles. This study follows up on another investigation that found an
area of the brain that plays a substantial role in decision-making, employing
additional algorithms to corroborate and add to the findings reported. The goal
of this project is to demonstrate the importance as well as the proper process
of reproducible computational science.
