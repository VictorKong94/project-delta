\par \indent In the second half we would focus on behavioral loss aversion
analysis. We assessed behavioral sensitivity to gains and losses by fitting a
logistic regression to each participant's acceptability judgments collected 
during scanning, using the amount of gain, loss and the amount of the absolute 
difference between gain-loss combination as independent variables. On top of
this, we perform another logistic regression without the third variable which 
is the difference between gain-loss pair. The purpose of doing the second
regression is to set up a comparison and see the to what extent does  having a 
weaker preference contribute to accept or reject the offer. Based on this 
analysis, we computed a measure of behavioral loss aversion $\lambda$ as the ratio
of the (absolute) loss response to the gain response, which is yielded a median
$\lambda$ = 1.882939 (range: 0.9505497 to 4.8956078) if the euclidean distance of 
gain/loss combination from the diagonal of the gamble matrix is not included, 
and a median of 1.861554 (range: 0.652284 to 5.345733) otherwise. Both
measurements are slightly different form the statistics stated in the paper that
lambda is a median of 1.93, ranging from 0.99 to 6.75. In general, this finding
is consistent with the observations that participants were, on average,
indifferent to gambles in which the potential gain was twice the amount of the 
potential loss. The estimated coefficients in front of gain, loss and 
with/without euclidean distance vastly vary across participants. 
    
\par \indent We first investigated individual behavioral responses in decision 
making. The data set contains three runs for each subject, meanwhile, each run 
from each subject corresponds to one particular gain/loss combination. We take 
subject 001 and run 001 for example, the results are displayed below. We
observed that using the additional parameter of euclidean distance, all
p-values indicate statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level. We
interpret $\beta$ to be the increase in log-odds of the event that the subject 
takes the offer for a unit increase in one of the three conditions when all 
other explanatory variables are held constant. In other words, $e^{\beta}$
denotes the factor by which the odds of success (success means response accepts
the gain/loss combination) change for a unit increase in one of three
explanatory variables (all other explanatory variables remaining unchanged). We
obtained positive estimated coefficients for gain and negative estimated
coefficients for loss with the latter slightly smaller.
