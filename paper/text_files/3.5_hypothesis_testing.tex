\par \indent Logistic Regression is performed to test and verify a point stated
in the paper, "This latter variable was included because of behavioral evidence
suggesting greater difficulaty making a decision for trials in which
participants had the weakest preference." The null hypothesis states that the
coefficient in front of the third beta is 0. The alternative hypothesis is 
tested against that. The positive weight means that the variable increases the
probability of the outcome, while a negative weight means that the variable
decreases the probability of the outcome. A large weight means that the variable
strongly influences the probability of the ourcome while a near-zero weight
means that the variable has litle influence on the probability of the outcome.
\par The linear regression is performed on the neural data to test the 
hypothesis that which stimulus (out of four conditions) has a influence/
correlation for each participant (out of sixteen).
