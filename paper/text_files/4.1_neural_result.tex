\par \indent By convolution, we get four simulated BOLD signals for four
conditions[Figure \ref{fig:convolution}].Before we perform linear regression,
we try to find outliers first. So we plot the SD for each volume [Figure
\ref{fig:VolumeSD}]. However, we did not find outliers. Then we perform linear
regression and get MRSS about 40.38 which is relatively low. So this model fit
the data pretty well.
