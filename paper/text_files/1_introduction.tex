% TeX file: 1 Introduction

\par

\par \indent This study recruited sixteen right-handed, English-speaking individuals between the ages of 19 and 28. There is confusion about the sexes of the individuals as the supplement to the published article reports seven males and nine females, while the data made publicly available reports eight males and eight females. It is known that all subjects were physically healthy and free of neurological and psychiatric history, and that their informed consent was acquired prior to their participation in the study.

Identify a published fMRI paper and the accompanying data
\cite{lindquist2008statistical}.  You should explain the basic idea of the
paper in a paragraph.  You should also perform basic sanity check on the data
(e.g., can you downloaded, can you load the files, confirm that you have the
correct number of subjects).

Briefly explain what reproducibility means and in what sense you will
try to reproduce this study.
