\par This study recruited sixteen right-handed, English-speaking individuals between the ages of 19 and 28. There is confusion about the sexes of the individuals as the supplement to the published article reports seven males and nine females, while the data made publicly available reports eight males and eight females. It is known that all participants were physically healthy and free of neurological and psychiatric history, and that their informed consent 

\par \indent The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) measures risk-taking behavior by presenting participants with a computerized balloon. The participant can earn money incrementally by pumping up the balloon, but after an unknown threshold, the balloon will explode. At any time, the participant elect to cash out his or her earnings, but doing so eliminates the potential to gain additional money through pumps. If the balloon explodes, the participant loses all of the money for the trial. For this study, BART and fMRI data for 24 subjects was collected. The mean age of the subjects was 20.8, and ten of the subjects were female. Four behavioral variables were recorded for each subject: the average number of pumps for each balloon, the average amount of money earned across runs, the number of exploded balloons, and the number of trials. There were also three model conditions: events for inflating the balloon (excluding the very last inflation of each trial), the last inflation before an explosion, and the event of cashing out (the balloon explosion was not included as an event). Of interest for our work is the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) imaging data recorded for each subject during the course of task. Each subject's BOLD data was recorded as 64 by 64 image matrices in 34 slices, with a variable number of time points.
