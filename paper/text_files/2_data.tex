\par The original study recruited sixteen right-handed, English-speaking
individuals between the ages of 19 and 28. There is confusion about the sexes of
the individuals as the supplement to the published article reports seven males
and nine females, while the data made publicly available reports eight males and
eight females. It is known that all subjects were physically healthy and free of
neurological and psychiatric history, and that their informed consent was
acquired prior to their participation in the study.
\par \indent These subjects participated in three runs of 85-86 trials of a
single task. This task involved offering the subject a wager with an equal
chance of winning or losing known amounts of money. Potential gains were in even
denominations between \$10 and \$40, while potential losses were in integer
denominations between \$5 and \$20. The participants were prompted to either
strongly accept, weakly accept, weakly decline, or strongly decline the wager in
each trial. At the same time that investigators collected these behavioral
responses, data pertaining to neural activity was recorded via fMRI.
